# Karpathy-verse

These are my notes on Andrej Karpathy's lecture series. In this series, he builds micrograd, makemore and covers the training of various types of neural networks in detail. I admire Andrej and the way he teaches a concept is truly phenomenal. I learnt a lot of new things from these lectures such as how to initialize the network, PyTorch internals, how to visualize the gradients or activations, and a lot more things.
